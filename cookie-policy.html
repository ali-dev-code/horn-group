      <h3>
        What are Web Beacons?
      </h3>

      <p>
        THE HORN GROUP occasionally advertises on third-party web sites. As part of our effort to
        track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification
        technology such as “web beacons”, or “action tags”, which count visitors who have come to
        the website after being exposed to an THE HORN GROUP banner ad on a third-party site.
        We do not use this technology to access your personal information and it is only used to
        compile aggregated statistics about visitors who come to the website to gauge the
        effectiveness of our ads.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>
        What is a cookie?
      </h3>

      <p>
        A “cookie” is a technology that allows the website to store tokens of information (an
        “identifier”) in your browser used by the website while you are on the website. Cookies are
        then sent back to the website on each subsequent visit, or to another webpage that recognizes
        that cookie. Cookies are used in order to make the website work, or to work more efficiently,
        as well as to provide information to the owners of the website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently,
        remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies may
        tell us, for example, whether you have visited the website before or whether you are a new
        visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and
        your interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        When landing on the website, you have been given the opportunity to accept cookies used on
        the website, to accept certain categories of cookies and decline others, or to decline all
        cookies. If you have accepted our use of some or all cookies, the following information
        relates to cookies used on the website only. Please note that any consent to accept or to
        decline cookies is limited to the The Horn Group website and the My THE HORN GROUP portal only and not to other local THE
        HORN GROUP sites or any other pages, which may be
        hyperlinked to our website or portal. For more information on cookies used by those websites,
        please refer to the specific privacy notice or cookie policy on those websites. If you have any
        questions please contact us.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two broad categories of cookies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> First party cookies, served directly by us to your device. </li>
        <li> Third-party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some
        cookies are “session cookies”, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These
        are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are “permanent
        cookies”, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by the
        website to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet
        again.
      </p>

      <p> <strong>Do Not Track</strong> </p>
      <p>
        If we detect that you have enabled the Do Not Track setting in your browser, we will
        automatically disable Advertising/Targeting cookies.
      </p>

      <p> <strong>Cookies that have been set in the past</strong> </p>
      <p>
        If you have disabled one or more cookies, we may still use information collected from
        cookies prior to your disabled preference being set; however, we will stop using the disabled
        cookie to collect any further information.
      </p>

      <p> <strong> Changes to this Cookie Policy </strong> </p>
      <p>
        We will occasionally update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in our practices and
        services. When we post changes to this Cookie Policy, we will revise the “Last updated” date
        at the top of this Cookie Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use,
        and/or share information held in cookies, we will notify you by prominently posting notice of
        the changes on the website. We recommend that you check this page from time to time to
        inform yourself of any changes in this Cookie Policy or any of our other policies.
